# MACE_ASE-NEB_tests
An example for testing and analysing different implementations of NEB with the MACE ML force-field.

Running script found in either neb_tester.py (with HAWK GPU submission script) or on your PC with Testrunner.ipynb. The paths too the head directory will need to be changed (lazy coding on my part).

If you only care about the results, check out Testanalysis.ipynb!
